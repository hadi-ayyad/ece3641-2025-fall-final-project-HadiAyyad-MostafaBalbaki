ECE 3641 – Final Project (Fall 2025)  
Authors: Hadi Ayyad & Mostafa Baalbaki  

---

 Overview

This project implements a voice-controlled personal robot assistant using the Yahboom mobile robot platform, dual Raspberry Pi 5 boards, an ultrasonic sensor, and a 6-DOF robotic arm. The system responds to spoken commands such as “fetch green” and “return”, navigates around obstacles, retrieves a mug from a predefined location, and returns it to the starting point.

The design integrates:

- Wireless microphone voice recognition  
- Obstacle avoidance with an ultrasonic sensor  
- Predefined navigation path  
- Automated mug pickup using servo-controlled robotic arm  
- Safe object placement and return-to-start behavior  

This repository contains all project documentation, code, dataset material, presentation slides, and demonstration videos.
